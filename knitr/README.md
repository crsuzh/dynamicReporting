# Dynamic Reporting with knitr

## Installation

To use knitr you need 

* **R** (<https://www.r-project.org/>)

* the **knitr** package (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown>),
  install from an R session with `install.packages("knitr")`
  
* a **LaTeX** installation, for example TeX Live
  (<https://www.tug.org/texlive/>) or tinytex (<https://yihui.org/tinytex/>)
  
* Optional, but highly recommended is the **RStudio** IDE
  (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>). knitr can alternatively be
  used from other editors (<https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/editors/>), such as
  **Emacs**, or from an R session.
