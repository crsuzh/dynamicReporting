In this document we will give an example of dynamic reporting using a data set containing the names of newborn children in the city of Zurich since the year 1993. The data were downloaded from \url{https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/bev_vornamen\_baby\_od3700}.

\section*{Import data and perform manipulations}

We will now import the data and perform some manipulations, such as rename the
variables into English and computing the most common name by year and sex.

<< "data" >>=
## load data
dat <- read.csv(file = "../data/namesZurich.csv")

## data manipulations
library(dplyr)
datCleaned <- dat %>%
    rename(year = StichtagDatJahr,
           name = Vorname,
           sex = SexLang,
           births = AnzGebuWir) %>%
    group_by(year, sex) %>%
    top_n(n = 1, wt = births)
@

\section*{Data visualization}

We will now visualize the most common name by year and sex.

<< "plot" >>=
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = datCleaned, aes(x = year, y = births, color = sex)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = name), alpha = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_label(aes(label = name), alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE, 
               size = 2) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2020, 5)) + 
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of births",
         title = "Most common name in Zurich for newborns by year") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

\section*{Software versions and computational environment}

It is good practice to save details on software versions and computational
environment when creating dynamic reports.
