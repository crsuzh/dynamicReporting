# Dynamic Reporting with Quarto

## Installation

To use Quarto you need 

* **Quarto** (<https://quarto.org/docs/download/>)

* your language of choice among **R** (<https://www.r-project.org/>), **Python**
  (<https://www.python.org/>), and **Julia** (<https://julialang.org/>)
  
* Optional, but highly recommended is the **RStudio** IDE
  (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>). Quarto can alternatively be
  used from other editors such as **VS Code**, **Jupyter**, **Emacs**, or from
  the command line (<https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>).
