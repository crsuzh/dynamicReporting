## Analysis of traffic accidens

First of all, let's make sure, we get the data we need. The following `R` code chunk downloads a data set from city of Zurich's open data portal and imports it.

```{r}
#| label: download-data

# Set a name for our data file
filename <- "accidents.csv"
# Define where we want to download it from
source <- "https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/sid_dav_strassenverkehrsunfallorte/download/RoadTrafficAccidentLocations.csv"
# Check if we already have  it downloaded
downloaded <- if(file.exists(filename)) TRUE else FALSE
# If it is not yet downloaded, download it and save it 
# under the name defined above
if(!downloaded)
    download.file(url = source, destfile = filename)
# Rad the data file
data <- read.csv(filename, header = TRUE)
```

Nice, this went well! So now let's see what we have in this data set. The open data portal of the city
of Zurich
