# Dynamic Reporting with R Markdown

## Installation

To use R Markdown you need 

* **R** (<https://www.r-project.org/>)

* the **rmarkdown** package (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown>),
  install from an R session with `install.packages("rmarkdown")`
  
* Optional, but highly recommended is the **RStudio** IDE
  (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>). R Markdown can alternatively
  be used from other editors, such as **Emacs**, or from an R session.
