```{r "setup", include = FALSE}
## this is the R chunk to specify the options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, # display R code in output
                      warning = FALSE, # don't display warning messages in output
                      message = FALSE, # don't display package loading message in output
                      fig.align = "center", # center figures by default
                      out.width = "100%"
                      )
```

In this document we will give an example of dynamic reporting using a data set
containing the names of newborn children in the city of Zurich since the
year 1993. The data were downloaded from
<https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/bev_vornamen_baby_od3700>.

## Import data and perform manipulations

We will now import the data and perform some manipulations, such as rename the
variables into English and computing the most common name by year and sex.

```{r "data"}
## load data
dat <- read.csv(file = "../data/namesZurich.csv")

## data manipulations
library(dplyr)
datCleaned <- dat %>%
    rename(year = StichtagDatJahr,
           name = Vorname,
           sex = SexLang,
           births = AnzGebuWir) %>%
    group_by(year, sex) %>%
    top_n(n = 1, wt = births)
```

## Data visualization

We will now visualize the most common name by year and sex. 

```{r "plot"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = datCleaned, aes(x = year, y = births, color = sex)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = name), alpha = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_label(aes(label = name), alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE, size = 2) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2020, 5)) + 
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of births",
         title = "Most common name in Zurich for newborns by year") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```
